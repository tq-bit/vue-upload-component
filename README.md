# Vue.js drag & drop component

This repository is a boilerplate for my blog entry on How to [Build a streaming drag and drop upload section with Vue.js](https://q-bit.me/build-a-drag-and-drop-upload-section-with-vue-js).

You can set it up on your local mashine like this:

```sh
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/tq-bit/vue-upload-component.git
$ cd vue-upload-component

# Install node dependencies and run the development server
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to 127.0.0.1:8080 and start building.
